    <h2>React Data Fetching</h2>
    <p>While React's built-in hooks like <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code> are effective for managing UI state, handling remote data fetching and caching often requires more specialized tools. TanStack Query (formerly React Query) is a powerful library designed to manage server-state, offering features such as caching, background updates, and optimistic updates. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</p>
