    <h2>Code Structure in React</h2>
    <p>Maintaining a consistent code style and structure is essential for readability and collaboration in React projects. Tools like ESLint and Prettier have traditionally been used to enforce coding standards and formatting. However, integrating these tools can sometimes be cumbersome. An emerging alternative is Biome, a unified toolchain designed to streamline code quality processes.</p>

    <h2>ESLint and Prettier</h2>
    <p>ESLint is a static code analysis tool that identifies problematic patterns in JavaScript code, helping developers adhere to coding standards. Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that ensures consistent code style across a project. While both tools are powerful individually, their integration can be complex, requiring careful configuration to work seamlessly together.</p>

    <h2>Biome: A Unified Toolchain</h2>
    <p>Biome is an all-in-one toolchain that combines the functionalities of a linter and a formatter into a single, fast, and efficient package. Built with Rust, Biome offers performance advantages and simplifies the setup process by eliminating the need for separate configurations. It supports multiple languages and provides a comprehensive set of rules and formatting options. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</p>

    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>For projects seeking a unified and efficient solution, consider adopting Biome to streamline code quality processes.</li>
      <li>If your project already uses ESLint and Prettier, evaluate the benefits of transitioning to Biome to simplify configuration and maintenance.</li>
