  <title>React and Immutable Data Structures</title>
  <description>
    While JavaScript provides built-in tools to handle data structures as immutable, enforcing immutability can be challenging. Immer is a popular library that simplifies this process in React applications.

  <overview>
    <note>
      Immer allows developers to work with immutable data structures by enabling direct mutations on a draft of the state, which it then processes to produce the next immutable state.

      Immer is a small package that allows you to work with immutable state in a more convenient way. You can use pure JavaScript data structures and modify a draft object using the `produce` function. Immer takes care of creating the necessary copies and detecting accidental mutations.

      <feature>Simplifies deep updates in React components</feature>
      <feature>Detects accidental mutations and throws an error</feature>
      <feature>Removes the need for typical boilerplate code when creating deep updates to immutable objects</feature>
    </features>
    <usage>
      To use Immer, install it via npm:
      ```bash
      npm install immer
      ```
      Then, import the `produce` function in your React component:
      ```javascript
      import { produce } from 'immer';
      ```
      Use `produce` to create a new state based on the current state:
      ```javascript
      const nextState = produce(currentState, draft => {
        // Mutate the draft as needed
        draft.someProperty = 'new value';
      });
      ```
    </usage>
  </immer>
