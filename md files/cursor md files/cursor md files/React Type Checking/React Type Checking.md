    <h2>React Type Checking</h2>
    <p>Ensuring type safety in React applications is crucial for maintaining code quality and preventing runtime errors. Historically, React included an in-house props validation system called PropTypes, which allowed developers to define the expected types of props for components. However, PropTypes have been deprecated and are no longer included in React. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</p>

    <h2>Transitioning to TypeScript</h2>
    <p>The industry standard for type checking in React applications is now TypeScript. TypeScript provides static type checking at compile time, offering a more robust and scalable solution compared to PropTypes. By integrating TypeScript, developers can define types for props, state, and other variables, enhancing code clarity and reducing the likelihood of errors.</p>
    <p>For example, defining types for props in a component can be done as follows:</p>
    <code>
      type Item = {<br/>
        id: string;<br/>
        title: string;<br/>
      };<br/><br/>
      type ListProps = {<br/>
        list: Item[];<br/>
      };<br/><br/>
      const List = ({ list }: ListProps) => (<br/>
        <div><br/>
          {list.map((item) => (<br/>
            <div key={item.id}>{item.title}</div><br/>
          ))}<br/>
        </div><br/>
      );
    </code>

    <h2>Enhancing Validation with Zod</h2>
    <p>While TypeScript offers static type checking, runtime validation is also essential, especially when dealing with external data sources like APIs. Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library that complements TypeScript by providing runtime validation. It allows developers to define schemas and validate data at runtime, ensuring that data conforms to expected structures before use. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</p>
    <p>Integrating Zod with React Hook Form, a popular form library, enables developers to perform schema-based validation seamlessly. This combination ensures that form data adheres to defined schemas, providing immediate feedback to users. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</p>
