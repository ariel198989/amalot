    <h2>React State Management</h2>
    <p>React provides built-in hooks for managing state within components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>useState</strong>: Ideal for simple state management within a component.</li>
      <li><strong>useReducer</strong>: Suitable for handling more complex state logic.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For scenarios requiring global state management, the <strong>useContext</strong> hook can be utilized to pass data through the component tree without prop drilling.</p>

    <h2>When to Use useState and useReducer</h2>
    <p>The choice between <strong>useState</strong> and <strong>useReducer</strong> depends on the complexity of the state:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>useState</strong>: Best for straightforward state updates.</li>
      <li><strong>useReducer</strong>: Preferred when state transitions are more complex or involve multiple sub-values.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Combining these hooks with <strong>useContext</strong> allows for effective global state management.</p>

    <h2>Exploring Zustand for Global State Management</h2>
    <p>While React's Context API is useful for managing global state, frequent usage can become cumbersome. In such cases, Zustand offers a simple and efficient solution for global state management, enabling any connected component to read and modify the state. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</p>

    <h2>Alternative State Management Libraries</h2>
    <p>Despite Zustand's growing popularity, Redux remains a widely used state management library. For those using Redux, the Redux Toolkit simplifies development with a set of tools and best practices. Other alternatives include state machine libraries like XState or Zag, and local state management solutions such as Jotai, Recoil, or Nano Stores.</p>

    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Utilize <strong>useState</strong> or <strong>useReducer</strong> for component-specific or shared state.</li>
      <li>Implement <strong>useContext</strong> for managing minimal global state.</li>
      <li>Consider Zustand or similar libraries for extensive global state management needs.</li>
    </ul>
