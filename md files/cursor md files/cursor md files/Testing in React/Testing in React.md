  <description>
    Testing is a crucial aspect of building reliable React applications. The process involves various strategies, including unit testing, integration testing, snapshot testing, and end-to-end (E2E) testing.
  </description>
  <overview>
    <note>
      The backbone of testing in React is a comprehensive test framework, such as Jest, which provides functionalities like test runners, assertions, mocking, and spying.

  <snapshot_testing>
    <note>
      Snapshot tests capture the rendered output of React components, allowing for easy comparison between test runs. When the rendered output changes unexpectedly, the test framework will notify you.

  <e2e_testing>
    <note>
      For end-to-end (E2E) testing, Playwright and Cypress are two of the most popular choices. They simulate user interactions and provide comprehensive testing for full application workflows.
