    <h2>Routing in React Applications</h2>
    <p>In React applications, managing navigation between different views is essential. While frameworks like Next.js provide built-in routing solutions, for client-side rendered applications without such frameworks, implementing a routing library is necessary.</p>

    <h2>React Router</h2>
    <p>React Router is a widely adopted library for handling routing in React applications. It offers a declarative approach to define routes and manage navigation, making it a powerful tool for client-side routing. Developers can define routes using components like <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;Routes&gt;</code>, and navigate between them using <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> or programmatically with hooks like <code>useNavigate</code>.</p>

    <h2>TanStack Router</h2>
    <p>For projects emphasizing TypeScript support, TanStack Router is an emerging alternative. It offers full type inference, ensuring type safety throughout the routing process. This feature is particularly beneficial in large-scale applications where type safety can prevent potential bugs. TanStack Router also provides features like built-in caching and first-class search parameter APIs.</p>

    <h2>Implementing Code Splitting with React Router</h2>
    <p>To optimize performance, implementing code splitting at the route level is beneficial. React's <code>React.lazy()</code> function allows for lazy loading of components, ensuring that only the necessary code is loaded for each route. Alternatively, the <code>@loadable/component</code> library offers more advanced features for code splitting and can be used in conjunction with React Router.</p>

    <h2>Exploring Conditional Rendering</h2>
    <p>Before integrating a routing library, beginners can experiment with React's conditional rendering to manage different views within a single component. While not a replacement for a full-fledged router, this approach provides insight into component rendering based on state or props.</p>

    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>For most applications, React Router remains the standard choice for client-side routing.</li>
      <li>For projects requiring robust TypeScript support, consider exploring TanStack Router.</li>
      <li>Implement code splitting to enhance performance, using tools like <code>React.lazy()</code> or <code>@loadable/component</code>.</li>
      <li>Utilize conditional rendering to understand basic component rendering before adopting a routing library.</li>
