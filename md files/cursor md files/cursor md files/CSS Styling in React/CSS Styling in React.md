    <h2>CSS Styling in React</h2>
    <p>Styling React components can be approached in various ways, each offering distinct advantages. As a beginner, starting with inline styles and basic CSS is acceptable, but as your application grows, exploring more scalable solutions is beneficial.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Inline Styles</h2>
    <p>Inline styles involve applying styles directly within the JSX using the <code>style</code> attribute. This method is straightforward but can become unwieldy for larger applications.</p>
    <code>
      const Headline = ({ title }) =><br/>
        &lt;h1 style={{ color: 'blue' }}&gt;<br/>
          {title}<br/>
        &lt;/h1&gt;
    </code>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>External CSS Files</h2>
    <p>Utilizing external CSS files allows for separation of concerns, keeping styles in dedicated files. This approach enhances maintainability and readability.</p>
    <code>
      import './Headline.css';<br/><br/>
      const Headline = ({ title }) =><br/>
        &lt;h1 className="headline" style={{ color: 'blue' }}&gt;<br/>
          {title}<br/>
        &lt;/h1&gt;
    </code>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>CSS Modules</h2>
    <p>CSS Modules provide a way to scope CSS to specific components, preventing style leakage and conflicts. This method is particularly useful in larger applications.</p>
    <code>
      import styles from './style.module.css';<br/><br/>
      const Headline = ({ title }) =><br/>
        &lt;h1 className={styles.headline}&gt;<br/>
          {title}<br/>
        &lt;/h1&gt;
    </code>
  </section>

    <h2>Styled Components</h2>
    <p>Styled Components is a CSS-in-JS solution that allows for defining component-level styles using JavaScript. While it offers dynamic styling capabilities, it's worth noting that runtime CSS-in-JS solutions may have performance implications in server-side environments.</p>
    <code>
      import styled from 'styled-components';<br/><br/>
      const BlueHeadline = styled.h1`<br/>
        color: blue;<br/>
      `;<br/><br/>
      const Headline = ({ title }) =><br/>
        &lt;BlueHeadline&gt;<br/>
          {title}<br/>
        &lt;/BlueHeadline&gt;
    </code>

    <h2>Tailwind CSS</h2>
    <p>Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of predefined classes, promoting efficiency and consistency in design. It has gained popularity for its flexibility and ease of use.</p>
    <code>
      const Headline = ({ title }) =><br/>
        &lt;h1 className="text-blue-700"&gt;<br/>
          {title}<br/>
        &lt;/h1&gt;
    </code>

    <h2>Conditional Class Names</h2>
    <p>When applying class names conditionally in React, utility libraries like <code>clsx</code> can simplify the process, allowing for cleaner and more readable code.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Consider using utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS for their popularity and efficiency.</li>
      <li>Explore CSS Modules for component-scoped styling to prevent conflicts.</li>
      <li>Be cautious with runtime CSS-in-JS solutions due to potential performance issues in server-side environments.</li>
      <li>Utilize tools like <code>clsx</code> for managing conditional class names effectively.</li>
